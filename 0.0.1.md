# .phpnb 0.0.1

## 1. File Format
The .phpnb file is a ZIP-compressed folder containing a set of files:

### 1.1. metadata.json

The metadata file contains a single object which stores all the metadata for this notebook:

- `version`: string
- `runtime`: string
- `created`: ISO 8601 datetime string
- `modified`: ISO 8601 datetime string
- `authors`: array of strings
- `title`: string
- `description`: string
- `composer`: key/value object of composer dependencies to install when initializing

### 1.2. notebook.json

The notebook.json file contains an array of sections with the content and metadata necessary to render the notebook itself.

At the root of the file is an array containg Section object, with each object having the following structure:

```json
{
    "type": string,
    "input": string,
    "output": object
}
```

The `type` field MUST be one of:
- `"php"`: Contains executable PHP code
- `"input"`: Contains a reference to an input file
- `"markdown"`: Contains Markdown-formatted text
- `"text"`: Contains plain text

The `input` field is always string text:
- For `type=php` this will be PHP code without the opening or closing PHP tags
- For `type=input` this will be uuid of the input file
- For `type=markdown` this will be the markdown string
- For `type=text` this will be plain text

The `output` field is always an object with the following keys:

```json
{
    "uuid": string,
    "name": string,
    "mime": string,
    "base64": string
}
```

For this object:
- The `uuid` field is a unique identifier for this output, and also where the output is saved within the notebook
- The `name` field is a string value that will be used as the filename when exporting this content
- The `mime` field is a MIME type for the encoded content
- The `base64` field is the actual content, base64-encoded (even plain text!)

### 1.3. inputs/

Folder path storing UUID-named input chunks of various mime types. Every file is a JSON file which includes the uuid, mime and base64 content.

### 1.4. outputs/

Folder path storing UUID-named output chunks that correspond to outputs in the notebook.json file, being overwritten if the notebook is run.

### 1.4.1. Output MIME Types
Output data SHOULD use standard MIME types:
- `text/plain`: Plain text output
- `text/html`: HTML output
- `image/png`: PNG images
- `image/svg+xml`: SVG images
- `application/json`: JSON data

## 2. Example phpnb file structure

When unpacked, the file structure should look like this:

    /
      metadata.json
      notebook.json
      inputs/
        00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      outputs/
        00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

This structure assumes at least 1 input and output file is being stored here.

### 2.1. Example metadata.json file

The metadata.json file should look something like this:

```json
{
   "version": "0.0.1",
   "runtime": "8.3",
   "created": "2024-12-10T10:00:00Z",
   "modified": "2024-12-10T10:30:00Z",
   "authors": ["wogan@outlook.com"],
   "title": "Example PHP Notebook",
   "description": "Optional description field",
   "composer": {
      "example/dependency": "^1.0"
   }
}
```

This metadata file describes a notebook that:

* Uses file format v0.0.1
* Requires the php 8.3 runtime to execute
* Was created and modified at the given times
* Is attributed to 1 author
* Has a title and description
* When running, must first install the example/dependency

### 2.1. Example notebook.json file

The notebook file contains the actual notebook content in an array of sections. A sample file might look something like this:

```json
[
   {
      "type": "text",
      "input": "This is a sample notebook, where I'll use PHP to count the lines in a text file"
   },
   {
      "type": "input",
      "input": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
   },
   {
      "type": "php",
      "input": "$data = file('upload.txt'); echo count($data);",
      "output": {
         "uuid": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
         "name": "stdout.txt",
         "mime": "text/plain",
         "base64": "MTA="
      }
   }
]
```

This file describes a notebook that:

* Has a plain text section at the top
* Has a file upload called "upload.txt" which is saved into the notebook as guid 0000
* Runs a script that calls file() and count() on the uploaded file, outputting the content directly
  * "MTA=" will base64-decode to the string value "10", for the number of rows in the upload.txt file
